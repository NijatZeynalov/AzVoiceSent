# AzVoiceSent

The project aims to develop an automated system that can analyze voice recordings in Azerbaijani and classify the sentiment expressed by the speakers. By combining Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) technology with advanced machine learning techniques, AzVoiceSent aims to provide valuable insights into sentiment analysis in Azerbaijani speech data.

The project involves several key steps. Firstly, a dataset of voice recordings in Azerbaijani, paired with sentiment labels, is collected and prepared. These sentiment labels could include positive, negative, or neutral sentiments. Additionally, the dataset is diversified to capture different contexts, speaker demographics, and emotions expressed in the Azerbaijani language.

Next, Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) technology is employed to transcribe the voice recordings into text. The ASR system converts the spoken Azerbaijani language into written transcriptions, enabling further analysis and processing of the textual data. After obtaining the transcriptions, the project leverages advanced machine learning technique for sentiment classification.
